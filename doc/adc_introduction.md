# Introduction to Analog-to-Digital Converters
The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a device used to convert an analog signal (ex. voltage) into a digital measurment. As many sensors are analog in nature, the ADC is an important component when working with sensors and data acquisition. For an introduction to the general concept of an ADC, how to convert ADC samples, or just a refresher of the terminology, see the below video.

// TODO(Barach): ADCs in ChibiOS suck. Probably skip the ChibiOS part of this tutorial and jump straight to common library examples?
